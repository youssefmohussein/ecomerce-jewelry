      <h1>REFUND POLICY</h1>
      <p>
        VITA can accept returns up to 14 days after the receipt of your order.<br><br>
        You must email us within 7 days of receiving your order and return the item within the next 7 days,
        ensuring it reaches us within 14 days.
        Returns may take up to 7 working days to arrive unless sent via special delivery.</p>
      <p><b>Please read the information below:</b><br><br>
        The item is your responsibility until it reaches us.
        For your own protection, we recommend that you send the parcel using a <br>
        delivery service that insures you for the value of the goods.<br><br>
        The cost of returning the item is your responsibility.<br><br>
        VITA will not accept returns for any non-faulty items that have been worn.<br><br>
        Upon receipt of an order, if any item has been received with no seal,
        the customer should notify us by contacting us at client-relations@VITA.com on the same day if they wish to make
        a return.
        We advise all customers to check jewellery thoroughly upon delivery before removing any attached seals or tags
        and before disposing of any original packaging.
